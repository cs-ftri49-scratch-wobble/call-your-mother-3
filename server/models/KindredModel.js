// Stretch:

// Potential properties for both User and Kindred:
// User and Kindred properties:
// Birthday - user input text
// Pop psychology categories like love language, astrological sign, Meyers Briggs

// Kindred-only properties:
// Relationship label - user selects from predetermined options (ex- partner, caretaker/dependent, family, friend, coworker, classmate, neighbor, mentor/mentee, other)
// Relationship roles - user input text (ex- emotional support, advice, fun hangout, thought provoking conversation, bonding over shared interests)
// Relationship health - stored after after being assessed
// Relationship development goals - user input text (ex- spend more time doing hobbies together, create a comfortable environment to talk about physical/mental health)
// Suggestions - stored after being generated from predetermined properties being sent to ChatGPT along with userâ€™s own profile data if relevant, to create ideas for next interactions and gifts
